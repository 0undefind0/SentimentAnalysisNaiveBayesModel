There's some deals that might be cheaper than Lazada at times. Would recommend to check both platforms for the better deal. The voucher system in Shopee is a joke though. You can claim as much vouchers as you like but don't expect to be able to use it since they share a common maximum times it can be used among all their users. I guess that's the best ever way a shopping app can do to disappoint your shoppers every time you release a voucher.,deal might cheaper lazada time would recommend check platform better deal voucher system joke though claim much voucher like expect abl use sinc share common maximum time use among user guess best ever way shop disappoint shopper everi time releas voucher,3,1

"This an another failure of service. A straight forward refund agreed between buyer and seller cannot be settled after 4 days of chasing, escalation and trying to expedite the case id. 4 full days of numerous calls and I am still waiting. This is a joke. _____ Online customer service chat and dispute handling is terrible. Delays, not understanding the issue and terminating the chat or issue from Shoppee side with even resolving the issue",anoth failur servic straight forward refund agre buyer cannot settl day chase escal tri expedit case id full day numer call still wait joke onlin custom servic chat disput handl terribl delay understand issu termin chat issu side even resolv issu,1,1

"Received an item with defect and wasn't allowed to refund due to ""prolonged duration of order"". Money down the drain. Literally can't even use the item at all, what a waste. Also, Shopee takes the cake as worst customer service.

Ok. Issue was resolved and refund was processed accordingly however this was only after I raised the dispute the second time. First time the resolution was forced on me despite my request for dispute on the wrong item sent by the seller. Hope shopee can ban unscrupulous sellers and protect the buyers.,ok issu resolv refund process accordingli howev rais disput second time first time resolut forc despit request disput wrong sent hope ban unscrupul protect buyer,4,0
"During 10.10, my checkout page was stuck on loading screen. While queuing for shopee chat support, my $30 voucher has been used up. Shopee then replied almost 20 hours later, requesting for a video prove. Who in the right mind video records every single step they navigate? I hope that the support would have a taste of their own medicine one day.

"User Friendly platform. Flexible cash back points system which can be used to offset any purchase, unlike other platforms where the points system is merchant specific. Wanted to give 5 stars but decided to give 4 stars due to the following gaps compared to other platforms. 1. Allow online invoice printing for customer to use the receipt for proof of purchase for warranty purpose. 2. Allow self pick-up option at selected locations so that customer can save on delivery fees if needed.",user friendli platform flexibl cash back point system use offset purchas unlik platform point system merchant specif want give star decid give star due follow gap compar platform allow onlin invoic print custom use receipt proof purchas warranti purpos allow self pick option select locat custom save deliveri fee need,4,0
